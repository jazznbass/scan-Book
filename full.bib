First, the need for objective, systematic review procedures is discussed. Second, previous approaches for quantitative evaluation of outcomes of single-case research designs are reviewed. Third, procedures employed by the present authors are outlined using examples from recent synthesis efforts. Finally, implications for future reviews of single-subject research are described.},

	abstract = {It has been recognized that the two-phase version of the interrupted time-series design
can be frequently modeled using a four-parameter design matrix. There are differences
across writers, however, in the details of the recommended design matrices to be used in
the estimation of the four parameters of the model. Various writers imply that different
methods of specifying the four-parameter design matrix all lead to the same conclusions;
they do not. The tests and estimates for level change are dramatically different under the
various seemingly equivalent design specifications. Examples of egregious errors of
interpretation are presented and recommendations regarding the correct specification of
the design matrix are made. The recommendations hold whether the model is estimated
using ordinary least squares (for the case of approximately independent errors) or some
more complex time-series approach (for the case of autocorrelated errors).},
