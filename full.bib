	abstract = {It has been recognized that the two-phase version of the interrupted time-series design
can be frequently modeled using a four-parameter design matrix. There are differences
across writers, however, in the details of the recommended design matrices to be used in
the estimation of the four parameters of the model. Various writers imply that different
methods of specifying the four-parameter design matrix all lead to the same conclusions;
they do not. The tests and estimates for level change are dramatically different under the
various seemingly equivalent design specifications. Examples of egregious errors of
interpretation are presented and recommendations regarding the correct specification of
the design matrix are made. The recommendations hold whether the model is estimated
using ordinary least squares (for the case of approximately independent errors) or some
more complex time-series approach (for the case of autocorrelated errors).},

  abstract = {Measuring treatment effects when an individual's pretreatment performance is improving poses a challenge for single-case experimental designs. It may be difficult to determine whether improvement is due to the treatment or due to the preexisting baseline trend. Tau-U is a popular single-case effect size statistic that purports to control for baseline trend. However, despite its strengths, Tau-U has substantial limitations: Its values are inflated and not bound between -1 and +1, it cannot be visually graphed, and its relatively weak method of trend control leads to unacceptable levels of Type I error wherein ineffective treatments appear effective. An improved effect size statistic based on rank correlation and robust regression, Baseline Corrected Tau, is proposed and field-tested with both published and simulated singlecase time series. A web-based calculator for Baseline Corrected Tau is also introduced for use by single-case investigators.},

Unlike many generalizations of the univariate median, repeated median estimates maintain the high 50\% breakdown value and can resist the effects of outliers even when they comprise nearly half of the data. For bivariate linear regression with symmetric errors, repeated median estimates are unbiased and Fisher consistent, and their efficiency under Gaussian sampling can be comparable to the efficiency of the univariate median.}
