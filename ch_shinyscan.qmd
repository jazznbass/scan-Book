# Graphical user interface - Shinyscan {#sec-shinyscan}

The scan package includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to perform a wide range of operations and analyses supported by the package. This GUI is implemented as a Shiny application that runs in a standard web browser.

**shinyscan** was originally developed as a tool for teaching purposes. To facilitate this, the application displays the corresponding R syntax for each operation executed via the interface. Beyond its pedagogical utility, **shinyscan** is also well-suited for exploratory data analysis, and the visual presentation of results with immediate feedback.

## Start shinyscan

To run the shiny app, you need to install two additional packages: *shiny* and *scplot*.

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("shiny", "scplot"))
```

You can start the app by executing the function `shinyscan()` from the *scan* package. Based on your system settings, the app will immediately be opened within your standard browser or in R-Studios *internal viewer pane*:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2015.07.15.png){width="316"}

In case the app starts within the internal viewer pane, I recommend that you click *Open in Browser*.\
The app is organized into seven main menus (tabs), each serving a specific function:

-   **Data**: Create new datasets, load and save existing ones, and access example datasets.

-   **Transform**: Perform data selection, filtering, and other transformations.

-   **Stats**: Conduct statistical analyses using various single-case methods.

-   **Plot**: Generate and export single-case design plots.

-   **Power-test**: Perform power analyses tailored to single-case designs.

-   **Settings**: Modify the default behavior and preferences of the application.

-   **Help**: Access additional documentation and external resources.

By default, **shinyscan** opens with the **Data** tab selected.

## Data menue

### Input cases

The **Data** tab in *shinyscan* allows you to manually create single-case datasets (scdf, see @sec-scdf). This is particularly useful for small datasets without having to write R code. The interface is divided into several input fields:

**Values**

Provide the central dependent variable and phase structure of the *scdfs* with the values of a named vector. For example, `A = 1,2,3,4, B = 8,7,8,9,8,7, C = 8,7,6,7,6,5`. You can use line breaks to structure your data entry (you can remove the comma at the end of each line if you wish):

``` r
A = 1,2,3,4
B = 8,7,8,9,8,7
C = 8,7,6,7,6,5
```

**Measurement times**

Here you can optionally enter measurement times. If no measurement times are specified, they are automatically set to `1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

**Additional variables**

Add additional variables in the style: `[varname] = value, value, value, value, ...`.

If you want to add several variables, use line breaks:

``` r
engagement = 1,5,4,3,6,5
support = 3,4,2,5,6,4
```

**Case name**

An optional case name.

The **Add case** button adds the new case to the existing scdf.

The button **Remove case** deletes a case.

The **Clear all cases** button deletes the entire *scdf*.

The **Position** section is useful if you want to delete (or add) a case at a specific position.

After clicking on the **Add case** button, you will get a summary of the current *scdf* in the right output area:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-22%20at%2012.47.59.png)

You can continue to add several more cases.

Use the **Save scdf** button to save the *scdf* to your local hard drive. By default the output file has the following name: *scdf* followed by the *number* of cases, followed by the *phase names*, the *date* and *time*: (e.g., `scdf-01-ABC-250322-130744.rds`). By default, files are saved in *Rs* standard file format `rds`. The file format and filename can be changed in the **Settings** tab.

If you want to see the R syntax, go to the **Settings** tab and change ***show output as*** according to ***syntax:***

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-22%20at%2012.48.16.png){width="204"}

Switch back to **Data –\> New** and the output will show R syntax:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-22%20at%2012.48.43.png)

### Load existing data files

Switch to **Data -\> Load**:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2015.25.53.png){width="228"}

To open an *scdf* file, click **Open file** and choose the file from your hard disk.

Three file types are accepted:

1.  An `.rds` file containing the *scdf* (e.g., created with **save scdf**). See @sec-save-scdf.

2.  An `.R` file containing a syntax for creating an *scdf*. This text file must create an object called **study** which contains an *scdf*. Here is an example:

``` r
case1 <- scdf(c(A = 58, 56, 60, 63, B = 51, 45, 44, 59, 45, 39, 83))
case2 <- scdf(c(A = 47, 41, 47, 52, 54, 65, B = 55, 37, 51, 60, 60, 65, 55, 46))

study <- c(case1, case2) 
```

3.  A `.csv` file (see @sec-read-scdf for more information on the structure of these files).

If your data file contains a valid *scdf* object, the output pane will give you specific information about the data file:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-23%20at%2009.23.37.png){width="561"}

### Load an example data file

Select an example from the drop down list:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2015.26.53.png){width="444"}

A summary of the selected *scdf* is displayed in the output pane:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.33.08.png){width="554"}

You can now continue with the loaded or example *scdf* or go to **Data -\> New** to modify the dataset.

## Transform

The Transform tab allows you to modify, create, recalculate etc. new variables from your *scdf*.

If you make any changes here, all operations in other tabs (*stats*, *plot* etc.) will be based on the transformed *scdf*.

This tab also displays the raw-data contained in the *scdf*.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.33.27.png)

**Select cases**

Select cases either by case number or by case name. Use commas to select multiple cases and a colon to select ranges of cases (e.g. `1, 7:9, 10`).

**Combine phases**

This option is specifically designed for later analyses that compare exactly two phases (such as overlapping indices). If your *scdf* has more than two phases, you can define which phases are Phase A and Phase B. You can combine multiple phases into one phase by selecting multiple phases separated by commas. Select phases by number (1 for 1st, 2 for 2nd etc.) See @sec-select-phases for more details.

**Filter measurements**

This takes a logical expression defining a selection of measurements. You can use variable names within your *scdf* and R functions. For example, if you want to select all measurements above 6 you code `values > 6`. If you want to select all measurements whose values are above the median of Phase B, you code `values > median(values[phase == "B"])`. See @sec-subset.

**Transform variables**

This section allows you to create and modify variables in a complex way. For example, for create a new variable with standardised values code `values_std = scaled(values)`. See @sec-transform for a detailed description of the syntax.

**Set dependent variable**

If your *scdf* has multiple dependent variables, you can switch them for the further analysis and display in this field (see @sec-setvars).

Clicking on **Save transformed scdf** will save the transformed *scdf* to your hard drive.

## Stats

The purpose of this tab is to select and refine analyses procedures. The following section will provide an explanation of the functionality of the GUI. For more detailed descriptions and explanations of the statistical procedures, refer to the respective sections of this book.

The **Statistic** field serves as the gateway to a range of procedures. By default, teh descriptives of the *scdf* are presented.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.33.46.png)

**Output format** allows to switch to html output which possible for some, but not all functions (see @sec-export for details):

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.33.55.png){width="881"}

For some outputs it is possible to flip rows and columns for a better overview:

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.34.06.png)

For some procedures, specific **output arguments** can be set (either for their respective `print()` - text output - or `export()` - html output - functions). For example most html outputs allow to specify the number of decimals (e.g. `decimals = 3`).

**Save output** saves the output content. The save format (text, html, or docx) is based on the setting defined in the **Settings** tab.

### Function arguments

If you choose a statistical procedure which takes additional arguments, a list of the available arguments will be provided on the left pane. Here is an example for the *hierarchical piecewise regression* function. All arguments are provided with their respective default settings (please refer to the respective section in this book ot the help files for detailed explanations of the arguments):

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-22%20at%2013.20.59.png)

## Plots

Within the plot tab you can create graphs based on the scplot function (see @sec-scplot for details).

If you have a valid loaded/ created a valid scdf, a standard scplot will e shown here.

The **Arguments** section is textfield that allows to specify the plot. It takes one line for each scplot function.

``` r
  add_statline("mean")
  add_legend()
```

*scplot* has an extensive range of options. The three dropdown menus provide a selection of syntax examples. By clicking an example, it is added to the **Arguments** text field and can be specified for your specific needs. Clicking an argument does not replace previous arguments. If you want to remove a plot element, you have to remove the line from the **Arguments** text field.

**Stats templates** provides syntax for adding statistical lines and curves to the graph.

**Design template**s adds syntax for changing various design elements like a title, footnotes, a legend etc. It also has examples to specify colours and themes.

**Annotate templates** gives examples to add text, marks etc. to the plot.

![](images/Screenshot%202025-03-21%20at%2014.35.10.png)

By clicking **Save plot**, a png file of the plot will be exported. In the Settings tab, filename and size of the plot can be specified.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows users to customize various aspects of *shinyscan*’s behavior. The available options are grouped by functional area:

### Data

**Show output as** defines whether the output in the **Data** tab is shown as R syntax (`print(scdf)`) or as a summary (`summary(scdf)`).

**Syntax phase structure** specifies the coding of the phase structure when **Show output as** is set to *Syntax.*

**Prefix save filename** defines a prefix used for automatically generated filename when exporting the *scdf*.

**Save format** sets the export format of the *scdf* file.

### Transform

**Show output as** defines whether the scdf is displayed in hml or text format.

**Prefix save filename** defines a prefix used for automatically generated filename when exporting the transformed *scdf*.

**Save format** sets the export format of the *scdf* file.

### Stats

**Syntax with defaults** If set to *Yes*, the generated R syntax includes all function arguments, including those set to their default values. This can be useful for teaching and documentation.

**Rename predictors** allows choosing among three naming conventions for predictors in the regression output.

**Prefix save filename** defines a prefix filenames generated when exporting statistical results.

**Save format** sets the export format.

### Plot

**Prefix save filename** defines a prefix for filenames when exporting plots.

**Export width / height / dpi** set the dimensions and resolution of the exported `.png` file.

### General

**Html_engine** specifies the internal engine used to generate HTML tables, either via the [**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com/) or [**kableExtra**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kableExtra) package (for *scdf* and statistical results). Only **gt** currently supports exporting tables in .docx format. The **kableExtra** engine is retained for compatibility purposes but may be deprecated in future versions of the package.
