Currently, I am a professor for research methods and diagnostics at the department of inclusive education at the University of Potsdam in Germany. I studied education sciences at the University of Cologne where I also did my PhD in psychology. Thereafter, I got a tenured position as a senior researcher at the department of special education (also University of Cologne). Later I did my habilitation on "Pedagogic and psychology in learning disabilities" at the *Carl von Ossietzky University* Oldenburg.

My current work focuses on:

-   Single-case research designs, analyzing single case data, and reporting single-case based results.
-   Social inclusion and social participation in classrooms.
-   Implementation of Open Science and Data Science concepts into special education research.
