# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello everyone!

I am glad that you have found your way to this book as it tells me that you are starting to use the scan package. While `scan` is quite thoroughly developed, this book is at an early stage (about 40% done). I am constantly working on it and expanding it. At the moment there is no release version of this book. Only this draft, which most likely contains many errors.\
If you have any suggestions on how to improve the book, or want to report bugs, comments, feedback, etc., go to the gitHub repository of this book and contribute here <https://github.com/jazznbass/scan-Book/discussions>.

Thank you very much!

JÃ¼rgen

## General references {.unnumbered}

This book has been created using [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/) within the RStudio [@RStudio] environment. The analyses have been conducted with the **R** package `scan` at version `r packageVersion("scan")` [@R-scan] and `scplot` at version `r packageVersion("scplot")` [@R-scplot]. `r R.version$version.string` was used [@R-base].

Note: The cover has been designed by Tony Wilbert and Henry Ritter.\
Thanx for that!
