# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello everyone!

I am delighted to see that you have discovered this book, as it indicates that you are starting to explore the scan package. While scan has undergone extensive development, this book is still a work in progress (approximately 47% complete). I am continuously working on expanding its content. Currently, there is no official release version available; only this draft, which may contain errors.

If you have any suggestions for improving the book, wish to report bugs, or provide comments, feedback, and more, please visit the GitHub repository of this book and contribute here:  
<https://github.com/jazznbass/scan-Book/discussions.>

Thank you very much!

## General references {.unnumbered}

This book has been created using [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/) within the RStudio [@RStudio] environment. The analyses have been conducted with the **R** package `scan` at version `r packageVersion("scan")` [@R-scan] and `scplot` at version `r packageVersion("scplot")` [@R-scplot]. `r R.version$version.string` was used [@R-base].

Note: The cover has been designed by Tony Wilbert and Henry Ritter.\
Thanx for that!
