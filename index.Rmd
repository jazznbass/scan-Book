# Preface {-}

Hello!

I am glad your found your way to this book as is tells me you are beginning to use the scan package.  
While `scan` is quiet thoroughly developed, this book is an early stage. I am continuously working on it and extending it.  
At this point in time there is no release of this book evailable. Only this draft which is full of errors (code and typos).  

Thank you!
  
  Jürgen
