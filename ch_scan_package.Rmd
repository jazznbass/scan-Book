# Changes with version 0.50 

## New function names

With version 0.50 scan introduced new names for its functions. The old function names are still usable but they will return a "deprecated" warning telling you to use the new function names.

Table \@ref(tab:table-aliases) shows the changes.

```{r table-aliases, echo = FALSE}
out <- tribble(
  ~"Current function name", ~"Previous function name",
  "autocorr", "autocorrSC",
  "corrected_tau", "corrected_tauSC",
  "describe [since v0.52]", "describeSC",
  "fill_missing", "fillmissingSC",
  "outlier", "outlierSC",
  "overlap", "overlapSC",
  "power_test", "power_testSC",
  "rand_test", "randSC; rand.test",
  "ranks", "rankSC",
  "rci", "rCi; rciSC",
  "shift", "shiftSC",
  "smooth_cases", "smoothSC",
  "style_plot", "style.plotSC; style_plotSC",
  "tau_u", "tauUSC",
  "trend", "trendSC",
  "truncate_phase", "truncateSC"
)

print_table(out, "scan privious and current function names.")

```

## Change target variables in functions

All functions in R that analyze data now allow for temporarily changing dependent, phase, and measurement-time variables by adding three argument: 

`dvar` sets the dependent variable.  
`pvar` sets the phase variable.  
`mvar` sets the measurement-time variable.  

For example, `overlap(exampleAB_add, dvar = "depression")` will report overlap parameters for the variable *depression* while `overlap(exampleAB_add)` while take *wellbeing* as the dependent variable (as defined in the scdf). 

After finishing the analysis, the variables are set back to their original values as defined in the scdf.
