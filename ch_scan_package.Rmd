# The scan package

## Installing the *scan* package

You can use the `install.packages` function to install *scan*.

`install.packages("scan")` will install the stable version.

The current stable release is version `0.54`. Please look at Section *Software reference* for which version of *scan* has been used for creating this book and make sure you have this version or a newer one installed.

R contains many packages and it would significantly slow down if all packages would be loaded into the computer memory at the beginning of each R session. Therefore, after installing *scan* it needs to be activated at the beginning of each session you use R. Usually a session starts when you start the R program and ends with closing R.

For activating a package you need the `library` function. In this case `library(scan)`. You should get something like

scan 0.54 (2022-03-23)\
Single-Case Data Analysis for Single and Multiple Baseline Designs

indicating that everything went smoothly and *scan* is ready for the job.

## Development version of scan

Alternatively, you can compile the development version of *scan* yourself. This might be necessary if the stable version has some bugs or missing functions which has been fixed.

You may need some computer expertise to get the development version running. It is hosted on gitHub at [\<https://github.com/jazznbass/scan>](https://github.com/jazznbass/scan){.uri}.

For installation, you can apply the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package (make sure you have installed the `devtools` package before):

`devtools::install_github("jazznbass/scan", dependencies = TRUE)`

When you are running a Windows operating system you will probably have to install Rtools before. Rtools contains additional programs (e.g. compilers) that are needed to compile R source packages.

You can find Rtools here: [\<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/){.uri}

## Reporting issues with *scan* and suggesting enhancements

The *scan* gitHub repository at [\<https://github.com/jazznbass/scan>](https://github.com/jazznbass/scan){.uri} is the ideal place to report bugs, problems, or ideas for enhancing *scan*. Please use the issue tool (direct link: [\<https://github.com/jazznbass/scan/issues>](https://github.com/jazznbass/scan/issues){.uri}).

We are very thankful for any feedback, corrections, or whatever helps to improve *scan*!

## Functions overview

The functions of the *scan* package can be divided into the following categories:\
*Manage data*, *analyze*, *manipulate*, *simulate*, and *depict*.
