While scan is quite thoroughly developed, this book is at an early stage (about 40% done). I am constantly working on it and expanding it. At the moment there is no release version of this book. Only this draft, which most likely contains many errors.\nIf you have any suggestions on how to improve the book, or want to report bugs, comments, feedback, etc., go to the gitHub repository of this book and contribute here https://github.com/jazznbass/scan-Book/discussions.\nThank you very much!\nJürgen\n24 February 2023"

    "text": "1.1 A teaser\nBefore going into the details of how scan works, I would like to give you an example of what you can do with scan. It is meant as a teaser to get you motivated to tackle the steep learning curve associated with using R (but there is a land of milk and honey behind that curve!). So, do not worry if you do not understand every detail of this example, it will all be explained and obvious to you once you become familiar with scan.\nLet us set a fictional context. Suppose you are researching a method to improve the arithmetic skills of struggling fourth-grade students. You have developed an intervention programme called KUNO. In a pilot study, you want to get some evidence about the effectiveness of this new method, and you set up a multi-baseline single-case study with three students who participated in the KUNO programme over a period of ten weeks. during the course, you regularly measured each student’s numeracy skills 20 times using a reliable test. You also carried out a follow-up after eight weeks with five additional measures. I am now going to make up some data for this fictitious KUNO study, because it would be too difficult to carry out a real study and actually develop a real intervention method.\nWe use the scan package to code the data. Each case has 25 measurements. We have three phases: before the intervention (A), during the intervention (B), and a follow-up (C). Phases A and B are of different lengths. The cases are named and combined into a single object called strange_study.\n\ncase1 <- scdf(\n  c(A = 3, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, \n    B = 6, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7, 8, \n    C = 6, 6, 8, 5, 7), \n  name = \"Dustin\"\n)\ncase2 <- scdf(\n  c(A = 0, 1, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, \n    B = 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 5, 7, 6, 3, 8, 6, 4, 7, \n    C = 6, 5, 6, 8, 6), \n  name = \"Mike\"\n)\ncase3 <- scdf(\n  c(A = 7, 5, 6, 4, 4, 7, 5, 7, 4,\n    B = 8, 9, 11, 13, 12, 15, 16, 13, 17, 16, 18,\n    C = 17, 20, 22, 18, 20), \n  name = \"Will\"\n)\nstrange_study <- c(case1, case2, case3)\n\nNow we visualize the cases:\n\nplot(\n  strange_study,\n  ylab = \"Correct\",\n  xlab = \"Days\",\n  lines = c(\"loreg\", col = \"red\"),\n  phase.names = c(\"Baseline\", \"Intervention\", \"Follow-up\"),\n  style = \"chart\",\n  ylim = c(0, 30),\n  xinc = 2\n)\n\n\n\n\nNow we need some descriptive statistics:\n\ndescribe(strange_study)\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\n \n  \n    Parameter \n    Dustin \n    Mike \n    Will \n  \n \n\n  \n    Design \n    A-B-C \n    A-B-C \n    A-B-C \n  \n  \n    n A \n    6 \n    7 \n    9 \n  \n  \n    n B \n    14 \n    13 \n    11 \n  \n  \n    n C \n    5 \n    5 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    Missing A \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Missing B \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Missing C \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    m A \n    3.67 \n    1.71 \n    5.44 \n  \n  \n    m B \n    6.57 \n    4.69 \n    13.45 \n  \n  \n    m C \n    6.4 \n    6.2 \n    19.4 \n  \n  \n    md A \n    3.5 \n    1.0 \n    5.0 \n  \n  \n    md B \n    6.5 \n    5.0 \n    13.0 \n  \n  \n    md C \n    6 \n    6 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    sd A \n    1.37 \n    1.38 \n    1.33 \n  \n  \n    sd B \n    1.40 \n    2.10 \n    3.27 \n  \n  \n    sd C \n    1.14 \n    1.10 \n    1.95 \n  \n  \n    mad A \n    0.74 \n    1.48 \n    1.48 \n  \n  \n    mad B \n    1.48 \n    2.97 \n    4.45 \n  \n  \n    mad C \n    1.48 \n    0.00 \n    2.97 \n  \n  \n    Min A \n    2 \n    0 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    Min B \n    4 \n    1 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    Min C \n    5 \n    5 \n    17 \n  \n  \n    Max A \n    6 \n    4 \n    7 \n  \n  \n    Max B \n    9 \n    8 \n    18 \n  \n  \n    Max C \n    8 \n    8 \n    22 \n  \n  \n    Trend A \n    0.23 \n    0.21 \n    -0.08 \n  \n  \n    Trend B \n    0.25 \n    0.36 \n    0.91 \n  \n  \n    Trend C \n    0.1 \n    0.3 \n    0.4 \n  \n\n\nNote: \n\n n = Number of measurements; Missing = Number of missing values; M = Mean; Median = Median; SD = Standard deviation; MAD = Median average deviation; Min = Minimum; Max = Maximum; Trend = Slope of dependent variable regressed on measurement-time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-case data are often analysed using overlap indices.

    "text": "3.1 A single-case data frame\nScan provides its own data-class for encoding single-case data: the single-case data frame (short scdf). An scdf is an object that contains one or multiple single-case data sets and is optimized for managing and displaying these data. Think of an scdf as a file including a separate datasheet for each single case. Each datasheet is made up of at least three variables: The measured values, the phase identifier for each measured value, and the measurement time (mt) of each measure. Optionally, scdfs could include further variables for each single-case (e.g., control variables), and also a name for each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTechnically, an scdf object is a list containing data frames. It is of the class c(\"scdf\",\"list\"). Additionally, an scdf entails an attribute scdf with a list with further attributes. var.values, var.phase, and var.mt contain the names of the values, phase, and the measurement time variable. By default, these names are set to values, phase, and mt.\n\n\nSeveral functions are available for creating, transforming, merging, and importing/exporting scdfs."

    "text": "3.2 Create single-case data frames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scdf function call\n\n\n\nscdf(values, B_start, mt, phase, phase_design = NULL, name = NULL, dvar = “values”, pvar = “phase”, mvar = “mt”, …)\n\n\nThe scdf() function is the basic tool for creating a single-case data frame. Basically, you have to provide the measurement values and the phase structure and an scdf object is build. There are three different ways of defining the phase structure. First, defining the beginning of the B-phase with the B_start argument, second, defining a design with the phase_design argument and third, setting parameters in a named vector of the dependent variable.\n\n### Three ways to code the same scdf\nscdf(values = c(A = 2,2,4,5, B = 8,7,6,9,8,7))\nscdf(values = c(2,2,4,5,8,7,6,9,8,7), B_start = 5)\nscdf(values = c(2,2,4,5,8,7,6,9,8,7), phase_design = c(A = 4, B = 6))\n\nThe B_start argument is only applicable when the single-case consists of a single A-phase followed by a B-phase. It is a remnant from the time when scan could only handle sign-case designs with two phases. The number assigned to B_start indicates the measurement-time as defined in the mt argument. That is, assume a vector for the measurement times mt = c(1,3,7,10,15,17,18,20) and B_start = 15 then the first measurement of the B-phase will start with the fifth measurement at which mt = 15.\nThe phase_design argument is a named vector with the name and length of each phase. The phase names can be set arbitrary, although I recommend to use capital letters (A, B, C, …) for each phase followed by, when indicated, a number if the phases repeat (A1, B1, A2, B2, …). Although it is possible to give the same name to more than one phase (A, B, A, B) this might lead to some confusion and errors when coding analyzes with scan.\nWhen the vector of the dependent variable includes named values, a phase_design structure is created automatically. Each named value sets the beginning of a new phase. For example c(A = 3,2,4, B = 5,4,3, C = 6,7,6,5) will create an ABC-phase design with 3, 3, and 4 values per phase.\nUse only one of the three methods at a time and I recommend to use the phase_design argument or the named vector method as they are the most versatile.\nIf no measurement times are specified, they are automatically created as a series 1, 2, 3, …, N, where N is the number of measurements. in some circumstances it might be useful to define individual measurement times for each measurement. For example, if you want to include the days since the beginning of the study as time intervals between measurements are widely varying you might get more valid results this way when analyzing the data in a regression approach.\n\n# example of a more complex design \nscdf(\n  values = c(2,2,4,5, 8,7,6,9,8,7, 12,11,13), \n  mt = c(1,2,3,6, 8,9,11,12,16,18, 27,28,29),\n  phase_design = c(A = 4, B = 6, C = 3)\n)\n\n#A single-case data frame with one case\n\n Case1: values mt phase\n             2  1     A\n             2  2     A\n             4  3     A\n             5  6     A\n             8  8     B\n             7  9     B\n             6 11     B\n             9 12     B\n             8 16     B\n             7 18     B\n            12 27     C\n            11 28     C\n            13 29     C\n\n\nMissing values could be coded using NA (not available).\n\nscdf(values = c(A = 2,2,NA,5, B = 8,7,6,9,NA,7))\n\nMore variables are implemented by adding new variable names with a vector containing the values.

In most cases, you can keep the coding of the scdf as described above and run it again each time you work with your data. However, for large files, it is sometimes more convenient to save the data separately in a file for later use.\nThe easiest way is to use the R base functions saveRDS and readRDS for this purpose. saveRDS takes at least two arguments: The first is the object you want to save, and the second is a filename for the resulting file. If you have an scdf named study1, you can use saveRDS(study1, \"study1.rds\") to save the scdf to your drive. You can read this file with study1 <- readRDS(\"study1.rds\"). With getwd() you get the path to the current active folder you are saving and reading data from."

By default, the csv-file has to contain the columns case, phase, and values. Optionally, a further column named mt could be provided. The csv file should be build up like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: How to format a single-case file in a spreadsheet program for importing into scan\n\n\nIn case your variables names differ from the standard (i.e. “case”, “values”, “phase”, and “mt” ), you could set additional arguments to fit your file. read_scdf(\"example.csv\", cvar = \"name\", dvar = \"wellbeing\", pvar = \"intervention\", mvar = \"time\") for example will set the variables attributes of the resulting scdf. Cases will be split by the variable \"name\", \"wellbeing\" is set as the dependent variable (default is values), phase information are in the variable \"intervention\", and measurement times in the variable \"time\". You could also reassign the phase names within the phase variable by setting the argument phase.names. Assume for example your file contains the values 0 and 1 to identify the two phases I recommend to set them to “A” and “B” with read_scdf(\"example.csv\", phase.names = c(\"A\", \"B\")).\nFor some reasons, computer systems with a German (and some other) language setups export csv-files by default with a comma as a decimal point and a semicolon as a separator between values. In these cases you have to set two extra arguments to import the data:\nread_scdf(\"example.csv\", dec = \",\", sep = \";\")\n\n\n3.4.2 Other data formats\nread_scdf also allows for directly importing Microsoft Excel .xlsx or .xls files. You need to have the library readxl installed in your R setup for this to work. Excel files will be automatically detected by the filename extension xlsor xlsx or by explicitly setting the type argument (e.g. type = \"xlsx\").\n\ndat <- read_scdf(\n  \"example2.xlsx\", cvar = \"name\", pvar = \"intervention\", \n  dvar = \"wellbeing\", mvar = \"time\", phase.names = c(\"A\",\"B\")\n)\n\nImported 20 cases\n\nsummary(dat)\n\n#A single-case data frame with 20 cases\n\n          Measurements Design\n Charles            20    A-B\n Kolten             20    A-B\n Annika             20    A-B\n Kaysen             20    A-B\n Urijah             20    A-B\n Leila              20    A-B\n Leia               20    A-B\n Aleigha            20    A-B\n Greta              20    A-B\n Alijah             20    A-B\n...

Here are two examples:\n\n# Open document example. You need to have the readODS package installed.\ndf <- readODS::read_ods(\"filename.ods\")\nscdf <- as_scdf(df)\n\n# SPSS example. You need to have the haven package installed.\ndf <- haven::read_sav(\"filename.sav\")\nscdf <- as_scdf(df)\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Export data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe write_scdf function call\n\n\n\nwrite_scdf(data, filename = NULL, sep = “,”, dec = “.”, …)\n\n\nwrite_scdf() exports an scdf object as a comma-separated-variables file (csv) which can be imported into any other software for data analyses (MS OFFICE, Libre Office etc.). The scdf object is converted into a single data frame with a case variable identifying the rows for each subject. The first argument of the command identifies the scdf to be exported and the second argument (file) the name of the resulting csv-file. If no file argument is provided, a dialog box is opened to choose a file interactively. By default, writeSC exports into a standard csv-format with a dot as the decimal point and a comma for separating variables. If your system expects a comma instead of a point for decimal numbers you may use the dec and the sep arguments. For example, write_scdf(example, file = \"example.csv\", dec = \",\", sep = \";\") exports a csv variation usually used for example in Germany.\n\n\n3.4.4 Other data formats\nThe R system has many add on packages that allow to write data to almost any file format available. If you like to export an scdf in those formats, you firstly need to convert the scdf into a standard R data-frame with the as.data.frame() function. Now you can export the resulting data-frame applying the respective function from another package.\n\ndf <- as.data.frame(exampleABC)\n\n# Open document example.

By default, the grid style is applied. scan includes some further predefined styles. default, yaxis, tiny, small, big, chart, ridge, annotate, grid, grid2, dark, nodot, and sienna. The name of a style is provided as a character string (e.g., style = \"grid\").\nSome styles only address specific elements (e.g., “small” or “tiny” just influence text and line sizes). These styles lend themselves to be combined with other styles. This could be achieved by providing several style names to the plot argument: style = c(\"grid\", \"annotate\", \"small\"). A style overwrites the settings of all previously included style.\nBeyond predefined styles, styles can be individually modified and created. New styles are provided as a list of several design parameters that are passed to the style argument of the plot function. Table 5.3 shows all design parameter that could be defined.\nTo define a new style, first create a list containing a plain design. The style_plot function returns such a list with the default values for a plain design (e.g., mystyle <- style_plot()). Single design parameters can now be set by assigning a specific value within the list. For example, newstyle$fill <- \"grey90\" will set the fill parameter to \"grey90\". Alternatively, changes to the plain design can already by defined within the style_plot function. To set a light-blue background color and also an orange grid, create the style style_plot(fill.bg = \"lightblue\", grid = \"orange\"). If you do not want to start with the plain design but a different of the predefined styles, set the style argument. If, for example, you like to have the grid combined with the big style but want to change the color of the grid to orange type style_plot(style = c(\"grid\", \"big\"), col.grid = \"orange\"). plot(mydata, style = mystyle) will apply the new style in a plot.

All of them are implemented in the outliers function. Available methods are the standard deviation, mean average deviation, confidence intervals, and Cook’s distance. The criteria argument takes a vector with two information, the first defines the analyzing method (“SD”, “MAD”, CI”, “Cook”) and the second the criteria. For “SD” the criteria is the number of standard deviations (sd) from the mean of each phase for which a value is not considered to be an outlier. For example, criteria = c(\"SD\",2) would identify every value exceeding two sd above or below the mean as an outlier whereas sd and mean refer to phase of a value. As this might be misleading particularly for small samples Iglewicz and Hoaglin Iglewicz & Hoaglin (1993) recommend the use the much more robust median average deviation (MAD) instead. The MAD is is constructed similar to the sd but uses the median instead of the mean. Multiplying the MAD by 1.4826 approximates the sd in a normal distributed sample. This corrected MAD is applied in the outlier function. A deviation of 3.5 times the corrected MAD from the median is suggested to be an outlier. To use this criterion set criteria = c(\"MAD\", 3.5). criteria = c(\"CI\", 0.95) takes exceeding the 95% confidence interval as the criteria for outliers. The Cook’s distance method for calculation outliers can be applied with a strict AB-phase design. in that case, the Cook’s distance analyses are based on a piecewise-regression model. Most commonly, Cook’s distance exceeding 4/n is used as a criteria. This could be implemented setting criteria = c(\"Cook\",\"4/n\").\n\noutlier(exampleABC_outlier, criteria = c(\"MAD\", 3.5))\n\nOutlier Analysis for Single-Case Data\n\nCase Bernadette : Dropped 3 \nCase Penny : Dropped 2 \nCase Amy : Dropped 3 \n\n# Visualizing outliers with the plot function\nres <- outlier(exampleABC_outlier, criteria = c(\"MAD\", 3.5))\nplot(exampleABC_outlier, marks = res, style = \"annotate\", ylim = c(40,160))\n\n\n\n\nHere is the syntax for the upcoming scplot() function (see Chapter 15).\n\nscplot(exampleABC_outlier) %>%\n  add_labels(nudge_y = 15, text = list(size = 0.7)) %>%\n  add_marks(positions = res) %>%\n  add_theme(\"basic\") %>%\n  set_casenames(position = \"strip\") %>%\n  set_yaxis(limits = c(20, 120))\n\nWarning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (`geom_text()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIglewicz, B., & Hoaglin, D.

For example, the describe() function is also part of the psych package. Now, if you have loaded the psych package with library(psych) after scan the describe() function of scan will be masked (describe() would now call the corresponding function of the psych package).\nThere are two solutions to this problem:\n\nactivate the psych library before the scan library (now the psych describe() function will be masked) or\ninclude the package name into the function call with the prefix scan::: scan::describe()."

Each of the two list-elements could contain more than one phase which are concatenated with the c command. For example if you have an ABAB-Design and like to compare the two A-phases against the two B-phases select_phases(scdf, c(1,3), c(2,4) ) will do the trick.\n(As an alternative approach you can set the phases argument within the overlap() function.

It is the percentage of all data-points of the second phase of a single-case study exceeding the maximum value of the first phase.

Furthermore, PAND allows the comparison of real and expected associations (Chi-square test) and estimation of the effect size Phi, which equals Pearsons r for dichotomous data. Thus, phi-Square is the amount of explained variance. The original procedure for computing PAND does not account for ambivalent datapoints (ties). The newer NAP overcomes this problem and has better precision-power (Richard I. Parker, Vannest, & Davis, 2011a)."

Because NAP can only take values between 50 and 100 percent, a rescaled and therefore more intuitive NAP (0-100%) is also displayed. NAP is equivalent to the the U-test and Wilcox rank sum test.

Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Sauber (2011b) and is one of the more broadly used approach for reporting effect sizes of single case data. Unfortunately, various and ambiguous implementations of Tau-U exist (Brossart, Laird, & Armstrong, 2018; Pustejovsky, 2016). The tau_u function tries to cover several of these implementation. It takes an scdf and returns Tau-U calculations for each single-case within that file. Additionally, an overall Tau-U value is calculated for all cases based on a meta-analysis.\n\n8.8.1 Variations of Tau-U\nSeveral arguments an be set to define how Tau-U should be calculated. By setting the argument method = \"parker\", Tau-U is calculated as described in Richard I. Parker et al. (2011b). This procedure could lead to Tau-U values above 1 and below -1 which are difficult to interpret. method = \"complete, which is the default, applies a correction that keeps the values within the -1 to 1 range and should be more appropriate. In the original method proposed by Richard I. Parker et al. (2011b) data, calculations are based on Kendall’s Tau A which does not correct for ties. Alternatively, Kendall’s Tau B has a correction for Tau in the presence of ties. The tau_method can be set to decide on the tau method to use \"a\" for Kendall’s Tau A and \"b\"` for Kendall’s Tau B.\nHere is an example with setting that reconstruct the values from the original example in Richard I.

Please make sure you are using the latest scan version.\n\n\nIf you pass multiple cases to the tau-u function, it will calculate a Tau-U table for each case and an overall calculation via a meta-analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating a Tau-U meta analysis\n\n\n\nThe calculation of the Tau-U-meta-analyses involves the following steps:\n\nThe tau values are Fisher-Z transformed to \\(Tau_z\\).\nThe standard error for each transformed value is calculated as either:\n\\(se_z = {1 \\over \\sqrt{n-3}}\\) (Hotelling, 1953)\nor\n\\(se_z = \\sqrt{0.437 \\over n-4}\\) (Fieller, Hartley, & Pearson, 1957)\nThe average \\(tau_z\\) is the mean of \\(tau_z\\) weighted by \\(1 \\over se_z^2\\)\nThe standard error of the average \\(tau_z\\) is \\(se_{M_{tau_z}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sum{weights}}}\\) (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009)\nThe p value is calculated with a Z-test (form \\(Z = \\frac{M_{tau_z}}{se_{M_{tau_z}}}\\) )\nThe overall tau value is derived from an inverse-Fisher-Z-transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.8.3 Confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default method for calculating the confidence interval has changed with scan version 0.55.7. Confidence intervals could have been outside the [-1, 1] in earlier versions. Set ci_method = \"s\" for a replication of results from scan version 0.55.6 or earlier.\n\n\nBy default, 95% percent intervals are calculated for each tau value. You can specify a different interval with the ci argument (ci = 0.90 will calculate a 90% interval). There are three alternative approaches to calculating the confidence intervals. When ci_method = \"z\" is set (the default), a general formula for calculating the standard-error of Fisher-Z values is used (Hotelling, 1953). If ci_method = \"tau\", a specific formula for Fisher-Z transformed tau values is applied (Fieller et al., 1957). Both approaches give similar results. A third approach is derived from the standard deviation of the S statistic1. Set ci_method = \"s\" for this method. The S method could lead to implausible values blow -1 or above 1. I recommend to use the common “z” method or the accurate “tau” method.\n\ntau_u(exampleAB, ci = 0.90, ci_method = \"tau\")\n\nTau-U\nMethod: complete \nApplied Kendall's Tau-b\n90% CIs for tau are reported.\nCI method: \n\nTau-U meta analyses:\nWeight method: z\n90% CIs are reported.\n\n                       Model Tau_U   se CI lower CI upper   z       p\n                     A vs. B  1.00 0.14     1.00     1.00 Inf 0.0e+00\n           A vs. B - Trend A  0.59 0.14     0.42     0.72 4.8 1.3e-06\n           A vs. B + Trend B  0.75 0.14     0.63     0.83 6.9 4.4e-12\n A vs. B + Trend B - Trend A  0.74 0.14     0.61     0.82 6.7 1.8e-11\n\nCase: Johanna \n                             Tau CI lower CI upper  SD_S    Z     p\nA vs. B                     1.00      NaN      NaN 22.91 3.27 <.001\nA vs. B - Trend A           0.59     0.39     0.74 23.26 3.22 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B           0.79     0.66     0.87 30.53 4.75 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B - Trend A 0.77     0.63     0.86 30.81 4.71 <.001\n\nCase: Karolina \n                             Tau CI lower CI upper  SD_S    Z     p\nA vs. B                     0.94     0.90     0.96 22.91 3.06 <.001\nA vs. B - Trend A           0.55     0.34     0.71 23.25 3.01 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B           0.80     0.69     0.88 30.52 4.85 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B - Trend A 0.78     0.65     0.87 30.79 4.81 <.001\n\nCase: Anja \n                             Tau CI lower CI upper  SD_S    Z     p\nA vs. B                     0.97     0.94     0.98 22.91 3.14 <.001\nA vs. B - Trend A           0.62     0.43     0.76 23.21 3.36 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B           0.63     0.43     0.76 30.45 3.74 <.001\nA vs. B + Trend B - Trend A 0.64     0.45     0.78 30.71 3.91 <.001"

    "section": "9.2 Adjusting the model",
    "text": "9.2 Adjusting the model\nThe plm model is a complex model specifically suited for single-case studies. It entails a series of important parameters. Nevertheless, often we have specific theoretical assumption that do no include some of these parameters. We might, for example, only expect an immediate but not a continuous change from a medical intervention. Therefore, it would not be useful to include the slope-effect into our modelling. Vice versa, we could investigate an intervention that will just develop across time without an immediate change with the intervention start. Here we should drop the level-effect from out model. Even the assumption of a trend-effect can be dropped in cases where we do not expect a serial dependency of the data and we do not assume intervention independent changes within the time-frame of the study.\nIt is important to keep in mind, that an overly complex model might have negative effects on the test power of an analyses (that is, the probability of detecting an actually existing effect is diminished) (see Wilbert, Lüke, & Börnert-Ringleb, 2022)\n\n9.2.1 The slope, level, and trend arguments\n\nThe plm function comes with three arguments (slope, level, and trend) to include or drop the respective predictors from the plm model. Buy default, all arguments are set TRUE and a full plm model is applied to the data.\nConsider the following data example:\n\nexample <- scdf(\n   values = c(A = 55, 58, 53, 50, 52, \n              B = 55, 68, 68, 81, 67, 78, 73, 72, 78, 81, 78, 71, 85, 80, 76)\n)\n\nplm(example)\n\nPiecewise Regression Analysis\n\nContrast model: W / level = first, slope = first\n\nFitted a gaussian distribution.\nF(3, 16) = 21.36; p = 0.000; R² = 0.800; Adjusted R² = 0.763\n\n                   B   2.5%  97.5%    SE      t     p delta R²\nIntercept     56.400 48.070 64.730 4.250 13.270 0.000         \nTrend mt      -1.400 -4.801  2.001 1.735 -0.807 0.432   0.0081\nLevel phase B 16.967  4.510 29.424 6.356  2.670 0.017   0.0890\nSlope phase B  2.500 -0.961  5.961 1.766  1.416 0.176   0.0250\n\nAutocorrelations of the residuals\n lag    cr\n   1 -0.28\n   2  0.05\n   3 -0.11\n\nFormula: values ~ 1 + mt + phaseB + interB\n\n\nThe piecewise regression reveals a significant level effect and two non significant effects for trend and slope. In a further analyses we would like to put the slope effect out of the equation. The easiest way to do this is to set the slope argument to FALSE.\n\nplm(example, slope = FALSE)\n\nPiecewise Regression Analysis\n\nContrast model: W / level = first, slope = first\n\nFitted a gaussian distribution.\nF(2, 17) = 29.30; p = 0.000; R² = 0.775; Adjusted R² = 0.749\n\n                   B   2.5%  97.5%    SE      t     p delta R²\nIntercept     51.572 46.455 56.690 2.611 19.752 0.000         \nTrend mt       1.014  0.364  1.664 0.332  3.057 0.007   0.1236\nLevel phase B 10.329  1.674 18.983 4.416  2.339 0.032   0.0724\n\nAutocorrelations of the residuals\n lag    cr\n   1 -0.07\n   2  0.06\n   3 -0.17\n\nFormula: values ~ 1 + mt + phaseB\n\n\nIn the resulting estimations the trend and level effects are now significant. The model estimated a trend effect of 1.01 points per measurement time and a level effect of 10.33 points. That is, with the beginning of the intervention (the B-phase) the score increases by 15.38 points (5 x 1.01 + 10.33)."

These dummy variables are used to compute the slope and level effects of the phase variable.\nThe phase variable is categorical, identifying the phase of each measurement. Typically, categorical variables are implemented by means of dummy variables. In a piecewise regression model two phase effects have to be estimated: a level effect and a slope effect. The level effect is implemented quite straight forward: for each phase beginning with the second phase a new dummy variable is created with values of zero for all measurements except the measurements of the phase in focus where values of one are set.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    values \n    phase \n    mt \n    level B \n  \n \n\n  \n    3 \n    A \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    A \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    A \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    A \n    4 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    B \n    5 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    B \n    7 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    B \n    8 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    9 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor estimating the slope effect of each phase, another kind of dummy variables have to be created. Like the dummy variables for level effects the values are set to zero for all measurements except the ones of the phase in focus. Here, values start to increase with every measurement until the end of the phase.\nVarious suggestions have been made regarding the way in which these values increase (see Huitema & Mckean, 2000). The B&L-B model starts with a one at the first measurement of the phase and increases with every measurement while the H-M model starts with a zero.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nslope B\n\n  \n    values \n    phase \n    mt \n    level B \n    model B&L-M \n    model H-M \n  \n \n\n  \n    3 \n    A \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    A \n    2 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    A \n    3 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    A \n    4 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    B \n    5 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    6 \n    1 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    B \n    7 \n    1 \n    3 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    B \n    8 \n    1 \n    4 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    9 \n    1 \n    5 \n    4 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the H-M model will give you a “pure” level-effect while the B&L-B model will provide an estimation of the level-effect that is actually the level-effect plus on times the slope-effect (as the the model assumes that the slope variable is 1 at the first measurement of the B-phase). For most studies, the H-M model is more appropriate.\nStill, we have to be aware of another aspect. Usually, measurement-times in single-case designs are coded as starting with 1 and increasing in integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …). At the same time, the estimation of the trend-effect is based on the measurement-time variable. In that case, the estimation of the model intercept (usually interpreted as the value at the start of the study) actually depicts the estimation of the start value plus one times the trend-effect. Therefore, I implemented the W model (since scan version 0.54.4). Here, the trend-effect is estimated for a measurement-time variable that starts with 0. As a result the intercept will then represent the estimated value at the first measurement fo the study. The W model handles the slope estimation the same way as the H-M model. Since scan version 0.54.4 the W model is the default.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmt\nslope\n\n  \n    values \n    phase \n    level \n    B&L-M and H-M \n    W \n    B&L-M \n    H-M and W \n  \n \n\n  \n    3 \n    A \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    A \n    0 \n    2 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    A \n    0 \n    3 \n    2 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    A \n    0 \n    4 \n    3 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    B \n    1 \n    5 \n    4 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    1 \n    6 \n    5 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    B \n    1 \n    7 \n    6 \n    3 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    B \n    1 \n    8 \n    7 \n    4 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    1 \n    9 \n    8 \n    5 \n    4"

    "text": "9.5 Designs with more than two phases: Setting the right contrasts\nWith single-case studies with more than two phases it gets a bit more complicated. Applying the models described above to three phases would result in a comparison between each phase and the first phase (usually phase A). That is, the regression weights and significance tests indicate the differences between each phase and the phase A values. Another common use is to compare the effects of one phase with the preceding phase.\nSince scan version 0.54.4 plm allows to set a contrast argument. contrast = \"first\" (the default) will compare all slope and level-effects to the values in the first phase. contrast = \"preceding\" will compare the slope and level-effects to the preceding phase.\nFor the preceding contrast, the dummy variable for the level-effect is set to zero for all phases preceding the phase in focus and set to one for all remaining measurements. Similar, the dummy variable for the slope-effect is set to zero for all phases preceding the one in focus and starts with one for the first measurement of the target phase and increases until the last measurement of the case.\nYou can set the contrast differently for the level and slope effects with the arguments constrast_level and contrast_slope. Both can be either \"first\" or \"preceding\".\n(Note: Prior to scan version 0.54.4, the option model = \"JW\" was identical to model = \"B&L-B\", contrast = \"preceding\").\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncontrastfirst\ncontrastpreceeding\n\n\n\nlevel\nslope\nlevel\nslope\n\n  \n    values \n    phase \n    mt \n    B \n    C \n    B \n    C \n    B \n    C \n    B \n    C \n  \n \n\n  \n    3 \n    A \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    A \n    2 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    A \n    3 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    A \n    4 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    B \n    5 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    6 \n    1 \n    0 \n    2 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    B \n    7 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    B \n    8 \n    1 \n    0 \n    4 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    4 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    B \n    9 \n    1 \n    0 \n    5 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    5 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    C \n    10 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    C \n    11 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    2 \n    1 \n    1 \n    7 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    C \n    12 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    1 \n    1 \n    8 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    C \n    13 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    4 \n    1 \n    1 \n    9 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    C \n    14 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    5 \n    1 \n    1 \n    10 \n    5"

These are not affected by the contrasts and are identical to those for phase A in Table 9.1. In addition, in Table 9.2, the estimates for levelB and slopeC are identical since all models contrast the same phase (the first and the preceding phase are both phase A). The values here can be calculated from Table 9.11:\n\\[\nlevelB = intercept_{phaseB} - (intercept_{phaseA} + n_{PhaseA} * slope_{phaseA})\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\n\\[\n33.388 \\approx  74.855 - (60.618 + 10*-1.915)\n\\]\n\\[\nslopeB = slope_{phaseB} - slope_{phaseA}\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\n\\[\n1.303 \\approx -1.915 - (-0.612)\n\\]\n\n\n9.6.2 Phase C estimates\nThe levelC and slopeC estimates of the regression models in Table 9.2 are different for the various contrast models. Depending on the contrast setting, the estimates “answer” a different question. Table 9.3 provides interpretation help.\n\n\nTable 9.3: Interpretations of the effect estimates in various contrast conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrast level\nContrast slope\nInterpretation of level C effect\nInterpretation slope C effect\n\n\n\n\nfirst\nfirst\nWhat would be the value if phase A had continued until to the start of phase C and what is the difference to the actual value at the first measurement of phase C?\nWhat is the difference between the slopes of phase C and A2?\n\n\npreceding\npreceding\nWhat would be the value if phase B had continued to the start of phase C and what is the difference to the actual value at the first measurement of phase C?\nWhat is the difference between the slopes of phase C and B?\n\n\nfirst\npreceding\nWhat would be the value if phase A had continued until the start of phase C (assuming a slope effect but no level effect in phase B)?

Bellow I will show how the estimates from the piecewise regression models relate to the simple regression estimates from Table 9.1.

It allows for\n\nanalyzing the effects between phases for multiple single-cases at once\ndescribing variability between subjects regarding these effects, and\nintroducing variables and factors for explaining the differences.\n\nThe basic function for applying a multilevel piecewise regression analysis is hplm. The hplm function is similar to the plm function, so I recommend that you get familar with plm before applying an hplm.\nHere is a simple example:\n\nhplm(exampleAB_50)\n\nHierarchical Piecewise Linear Regression\n\nEstimation method ML \nContrast model: W / level: first, slope: first\n50 Cases\n\nICC = 0.287; L = 339.0; p = 0.000\n\nFixed effects (values ~ 1 + mt + phaseB + interB)\n\n                   B    SE   df      t p\nIntercept     48.398 1.484 1328 32.611 0\nTrend mt       0.579 0.116 1328  5.006 0\nLevel phase B 14.038 0.655 1328 21.436 0\nSlope phase B  0.902 0.119 1328  7.588 0\n\nRandom effects (~1 | case)\n\n          EstimateSD\nIntercept      9.970\nResidual       5.285\n\n\nHere is an example inlcuding random slopes:\n\nhplm(exampleAB_50, random.slopes = TRUE)\n\nHierarchical Piecewise Linear Regression\n\nEstimation method ML \nContrast model: W / level: first, slope: first\n50 Cases\n\nICC = 0.287; L = 339.0; p = 0.000\n\nFixed effects (values ~ 1 + mt + phaseB + interB)\n\n                   B    SE   df      t p\nIntercept     48.211 1.398 1328 34.497 0\nTrend mt       0.621 0.113 1328  5.516 0\nLevel phase B 13.872 0.894 1328 15.513 0\nSlope phase B  0.864 0.116 1328  7.433 0\n\nRandom effects (~1 + mt + phaseB + interB | case)\n\n              EstimateSD\nIntercept          9.352\nTrend mt           0.096\nLevel phase B      4.537\nSlope phase B      0.126\nResidual           4.974\n\n\n\n10.0.1 Adding additional L2-variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe add_l2 function call\n\n\n\nadd_l2(scdf, data_l2, cvar = “case”)\n\n\nIn some analyses researchers want to investigate whether attributes of the individuals contribute to the effectiveness of an intervention. For example might an intervention on mathematical abilities be less effective for student with a migration background due to too much language related material within the training. Such analyses can also be conducted with scan. Therefore, we need to define a new data frame including the relevant information of the subjects of the single-case studies we want to analyze. This data frame consists of a variable labeled case which has to correspond to the case names of the scfd and further variables with attributes of the subjects. To build a data frame we can use the R function data.frame.\n\nL2 <- data.frame(\n  case = c(\"Antonia\",\"Theresa\", \"Charlotte\", \"Luis\", \"Bennett\", \"Marie\"), \n  age = c(16, 13, 13, 10, 5, 14), \n  sex = c(\"f\",\"f\",\"f\",\"m\",\"m\",\"f\")\n)\nL2\n\n       case age sex\n1   Antonia  16   f\n2   Theresa  13   f\n3 Charlotte  13   f\n4      Luis  10   m\n5   Bennett   5   m\n6     Marie  14   f\n\n\nMultilevel analyses require a high number of Level 2 units. The exact number depends on the complexity of the analyses, the size of the effects, the number of level 1 units, and the variability of the residuals. But surely we need at least about 30 level 2 units. In a single-case design that is, we need at least 30 single-cases (subjects) within the study. After setting the level 2 data frame we can merge it to the scdf with the add_l2() function (alternatively, we can use the data.l2 argument of the hplm function). Then we have to specify the regression function using the update.fixed argument. The level 2 variables can be added just like any other additional variable. For example, we have added a level 2 data-set with the two variables sex and age. update could be construed of the level 1 piecewise regression model .~. plus the additional level 2 variables of interest + sex + age. The complete argument is update.fixed = .~. + sex + age. This analyses will estimate a main effect of sex and age on the overall performance. In case we want to analyze an interaction between the intervention effects and for example the sex of the subject we have to add an additional interaction term (a cross-level interaction). An interaction is defined with a colon. So sex:phase indicates an interaction of sex and the level effect in the single case study. The complete formula now is update.fixed = .~. + sex + age + sex:phase.\nscan includes an example single-case study with 50 subjects example50 and an additional level 2 data-set example50.l2. Here are the first 10 cases of example50.l2.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    case \n    sex \n    age \n  \n \n\n  \n    Roman \n    m \n    12 \n  \n  \n    Brennen \n    m \n    10 \n  \n  \n    Ismael \n    m \n    13 \n  \n  \n    Donald \n    m \n    11 \n  \n  \n    Ricardo \n    m \n    13 \n  \n  \n    Izayah \n    m \n    11 \n  \n  \n    Ignacio \n    m \n    12 \n  \n  \n    Xavier \n    m \n    12 \n  \n  \n    Arian \n    m \n    10 \n  \n  \n    Paul \n    m \n    10 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data with hplm could look like this:\n\nexampleAB_50 %>%\n  add_l2(exampleAB_50.l2) %>%\n  hplm(update.fixed = .~. + sex + age)\n\nHierarchical Piecewise Linear Regression\n\nEstimation method ML \nContrast model: W / level: first, slope: first\n50 Cases\n\nICC = 0.287; L = 339.0; p = 0.000\n\nFixed effects (values ~ mt + phaseB + interB + sex + age)\n\n                   B     SE   df      t     p\nIntercept     44.878 11.926 1328  3.763 0.000\nTrend mt       0.581  0.116 1328  5.026 0.000\nLevel phase B 14.023  0.655 1328 21.405 0.000\nSlope phase B  0.900  0.119 1328  7.569 0.000\nsexm          -6.440  2.727   47 -2.362 0.022\nage            0.603  1.073   47  0.562 0.577\n\nRandom effects (~1 | case)\n\n          EstimateSD\nIntercept      9.446\nResidual       5.284\n\n# Alternatively:\n# hplm(exampleAB_50, data.l2 = exampleAB_50.l2, update.fixed = .~. + sex + age)\n\nsex is a factor with the levels f and m.

The following comparisons are possible:\n\n“Mean A-B”: Uses the difference between the mean of phase A and the mean of phase B. * This is appropriate if a decrease of scores is expected for phase B.\n“Mean B-A”: Uses the difference between the mean of phase B and the mean of phase A. This is appropriate if an increase of scores is expected for phase B.\n“Mean |A-B|”: Uses the absolute value of the difference between the means of phases A and B.\n“Median A-B”: The same as “Mean A-B”, but based on the median.\n“Median B-A”: The same as “Mean B-A”, but based on the median.\n\nnumber\nSample size of the randomization distribution. The exactness of the p-value can not exceed 1/number (i.e., number = 100 results in p-values with an exactness of one percent). Default is number = 500. For faster processing use number = 100. For more precise p-values set number = 1000.\ncomplete\nIf TRUE, the distribution is based on a complete permutation of all possible starting combinations. This setting overwrites the number Argument. The default setting is FALSE.\nlimit\nMinimal number of data points per phase in the sample. The first number refers to the A-phase and the second to the B-phase (e.g., limit = c(5, 3)). If only one number is given, this number is applied to both phases. Default is limit = 5.\nstartpoints\nAlternative to the limit-parameter, startpoints exactly defines the possible start points of phase B (e.g., startpoints = 4:9 restricts the phase B start points to measurements 4 to 9. startpoints overwrite the limit-parameter.\nexclude.equal\nIf set to FALSE, which is the default, random distribution values equal to the observed distribution are counted as null-hypothesis conform. That is, they decrease the probability of rejecting the null-hypothesis (increase the p-value). exclude.equal should be set to TRUE if you analyse one single-case design (not a multiple baseline data set) to reach a sufficient power. But be aware, that it increases the chance of an alpha-error.\ngraph\nIf set TRUE, a histogram of the resulting distribution is plotted.\nphases\nA vector of two characters or numbers indicating the two phases that should be compared. E.g., phases = c(“A”,“C”) or phases = c(2,4) for comparing the second and the fourth phase. Phases could be combined by providing a list with two elements. E.g., phases = list(A = c(1,3), B = c(2,4)) will compare phases 1 and 3 (as A) against 2 and 4 (as B). Default is phases = c(“A”,“B”)."

    "text": "13.1 The idea of a power-test\nThe powert_test() function provides the alpha error probability and power when analyzing a specific effect of a single-case design with a given statistical method.\nFor example, you have a one case design with phase length A = 10 and B = 20. You assume a strong level effect of d = 1 and you expect a slight trend effect of d = 0.02 (per measurement). You might be interested to answer two questions:\n\nHow suitable is a plm model for detecting the level-effect? (also: what is the power to detect the level effect?).\nWhat if I had the same design but without a level-effect. How often would the plm falsely find a significant level-effect? (also: how large is the alpha-error probability for the level-effect?).\n\nIn principle, power_test() takes a single case design and repeatedly generates random cases based on that design. Each case is now analyzed with a given statistical method. The proportion of significant effects in these analyses is an estimator of the test-power. In a second step the design is stripped of the target effect and again multiple cases are generated on this changed design and analyzed with the same method. Now, the proportion of significant effects is the estimator for the alpha-error probability."

You can define various parameters of that design:\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.1:  Core arguments of the design function \n \n  \n    Argument \n    What it does ... \n  \n \n\n  \n    n \n    Number of cases to be created (Default is n = 1). \n  \n  \n    phase_design \n    A list defining the length and label of each phase. E.g., phase.length = list(A1 = 10, B1 = 10, A2 = 10, B2 = 10). Use vectors if you want to define different values for each case phase.length = list(A = c(10, 15), B = c(10, 15). \n  \n  \n    trend \n    Defines the effect size of a trend added incrementally to each measurement across the whole data-set. To assign different trends to several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. trend = c(.1, .3, .5)). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled. When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the trend parameters indicate effect size d changes. When using a binomial or poisson distribution, trend indicates an increase in points / counts per measurement. \n  \n  \n    level \n    A list that defines the level increase (effect size d) at the beginning of each phase relative to the previous phase (e.g. list(A = 0, B = 1)). The first element must be zero as the first phase of a single-case has no level effect (if you have one less list element than the number of phases, scan will add a leading element with 0 values). Use vectors to define variable level effects for each case (e.g. list(A = c(0, 0), B = c(1, 2))). When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the level parameters indicate effect size d changes. When using a binomial or poisson distribution, level indicates an increase in points / counts with the onset of each phase. \n  \n  \n    slope \n    A list that defines the increase per measurement for each phase compared to the previous phase. slope = list(A = 0, B = .1 generates an incremental increase of 0.1 per measurement starting at the B phase. The first list element must be zero as the first phase of a single-case has no slope effect (if you have one less list element than the number of phases, scan will add a leading element with 0 values). Use vectors to define variable slope effects for each case (e.g. list(A = c(0, 0), B = c(0.1, 0.2))). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled. When using a 'gaussian' distribution, the slope parameters indicate effect size d changes per measurement. When using a binomial or poisson distribution, slope indicates an increase in points / counts per measurement. \n  \n  \n    rtt \n    Reliability of the underlying simulated measurements. Set rtt = .8 by default. To assign different reliabilities to several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. rtt = c(.6, .7, .8)). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are repeated. rtt has no effect when you're using binomial or poisson distributed scores. \n  \n  \n    start_value \n    Starting value at the first measurement. Default is 50. To assign different start values to several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. c(50, 42, 56)). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled. \n  \n  \n    s \n    Standard deviation used to calculate absolute values from level, slope, trend effects and to calculate and error distribution from the rtt values. Set to 10 by default. To assign different variances to several single-cases, use a vector of values (e.g. s = c(5, 10, 15)). If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are recycled. if the distribution is 'poisson' or 'binomial' s is not applied. \n  \n  \n    extreme_prop \n    Probability of extreme values. extreme.p = .05 gives a five percent probability of an extreme value. A vector of values assigns different probabilities to multiple cases. If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are repeated. \n  \n  \n    extreme_range \n    Range for extreme values, expressed as effect size d. extreme.d = c(-7,-6) uses extreme values within a range of -7 and -6 standard deviations. In case of a binomial or poisson distribution, extreme.d indicates points / counts. Caution: the first value must be smaller than the second, otherwise the procedure will fail. \n  \n  \n    missing_prop \n    Portion of missing values. missing.p = 0.1 creates 10% of all values as missing). A vector of values assigns different probabilities to multiple cases. If the number of cases exceeds the length of the vector, values are repeated. \n  \n  \n    distribution \n    Distribution of the scores. Default is distribution = 'normal'. Possible values are 'normal' (or 'gaussian'), 'binomial', and 'poisson'. \n  \n  \n    prob \n    If distribution is set 'binomial', prob passes the probability of occurrence."

The power_test function applies three methods by default: plm, randomization test, and Tau U. These default values are only suitable when your design is a one case single-case study.\nLet us start with the defaults and conduct a power analysis for our previously set design: (This might take some time. Even in the default setting with 100 simulations you might wait a few seconds. For more precise estimations I recommend 1000 simulations - or even higher.)\n\nres <- power_test(design)\nres\n\nTest-Power in percent:\n\n    Method Power Alpha Error Alpha:Beta Correct\n plm_level    87           4      1:3.2      92\n      rand    78           4      1:5.5      87\n      tauU   100          26      1:0.0      87\n\n\nThe results show that the plm test and the randomization test have similar power and alpha-error probabilities (the differences here may be due to outliers of the random samples. A more intensive computation with 1000 simulations shows slightly better values for the plm). The tau U test has an unacceptably high alpha-error which is due to the trend we put into the design. Alpha:Beta depicts the relation of the Alpha and Beta error (power = 1 - Beta). Correct is the overall proportion of correct categorizations and p is the results of a binomial-test of Correct against 50%."

You can install it with devtools::install_github(\"jazznbass/scplot\", dependencies = TRUE) from your R console. Make sure you have the package devtools installed before. The package has to be compiled. When you are running R on a Windows machine you also have to install Rtools. Rtools is not an R package and can be downloaded from CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. MacOs and Linux users usually do not need to take this extra step.\nThe following chapter has been written with scplot version 0.2.10.

    "title": "Appendix A — Some things about R",
    "section": "A.1 Basic R",
    "text": "A.1 Basic R\nR is a script language. That is, you type in text and let R execute the commands you wrote down. Either you work in a console or a textfile. In a console the command will be executed every time you press the RETURN-key. In a textfile you type down your code, mark the part you like to be executed, and run that code (with a click or a certain key). The latter text files can be saved and reused for later R sessions. Therefore, usually you will work in a text file.\nA value is assigned to a variable with the <- operator. Which should be read as an arrow rather than a less sign and a minus sign. A # is followed by a comment to make your code more understandable. So, what follows a # is not interpreted by R. A vector is a chain of several values. With a vector you could describe the values of a measurement series. The c function is used to build a vector (e.g., c(1, 2, 3, 4)). If you like to see the content of a variable you could use the print function. print(x) will display the content of the variable x. A shortcut for this is just to type variable name (and press return) x.\n\n# x is assigned the value 10:\nx <- 10\n\n# See what's inside of x:\nx\n\n[1] 10\n\n# x is assigned a vector with three values:\nx <- c(10, 11, 15)\n\n# ... and display the content of x:\nx\n\n[1] 10 11 15\n\n\nTwo important concepts in R are functions and arguments. A function is the name for a procedure that does something with the arguments that are provided by you. For example, the function mean calculated the mean. mean has an argument x which “expects” that you provide a vector (a series of values) from which it will calculate the mean. mean( x = c(1, 3, 5) ) will compute the mean of the values 1, 3, and 5 and return the result 3. Some functions can take several arguments. mean for example also takes the argument trim. For calculating a trimmed mean. mean( x = c(1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9), trim = 0.1) will calculate the 10% trimmed mean of the provided values. The name of the first argument could be dropped. That is, mean( c(1, 3, 5) ) will be interpreted by R as mean( x = c(1, 3, 5) ). You could also provide a variable to an argument.\n\nvalues <- c(1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 7, 5)\nmean(x = values)\n\n[1] 4.75\n\n# or shorter:\nmean(values)\n\n[1] 4.75\n\n\nThe return value of a function can be assigned to a new variable instead:\n\ny <- c(1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 7, 5)\nres <- mean(y)\n#now res contains the mean of y:\nres\n\n[1] 4.75\n\n\nEvery function in R has a help page written by the programmers. You can retrieve these pages with the help function or the short cut ?. help(\"mean\") will display the help page for the mean function. The quotation marks are necessary here because you do not provide a variable with the name mean but a word ‘mean’. The shortcut works ?mean. A bit confusingly, you do not need the quotation marks here."

Various functions in scan now can handle such a data structure.\n\n\nB.1.2 Piping\nThe concept of piping is great for writing clean and intelligible code that is easier to debug. We imported the pipe function %>% from the magrittr package. Since version 4.1, R has its own pipe operator implementation |>. This is great and works fine with the scan package. But since the |> Operator is not backwards compatible for R prior versions 4.1, we will stick with the %>% for a while.\nTo allow for smooth “piping” we began adding some functions select_phases, subset, select_cases, set_var, set_dvar, set_mvar, set_pvar, and add_l2."

A moving average function (mean- or median-based) replaces each data point by the average of the surrounding data points step-by-step. A lag defines the number of measurements before and after the calculation is based on. So a lag-1 will take the average of the proceeding and following value and lag-2 the average of the two proceeding and two following measurements. With a local regression function, each data point is regressed by its surrounding data points. Here, the proportion of measurements surrounding a value is usually defined. So an intensity of 0.2 will take the surrounding 20% of data as the basis for a regression.\nThe function returns am scdf with smoothed data points.\n\n## Use the three different smoothing functions and compare the results\nberta_mmd <- smooth_cases(Huber2014$Berta)\nberta_mmn <- smooth_cases(Huber2014$Berta, FUN = \"movingMean\")\nberta_lre <- smooth_cases(Huber2014$Berta, FUN = \"localRegression\")\nnew_study <- c(Huber2014$Berta, berta_mmd, berta_mmn, berta_lre)\nnames(new_study) <- c(\"Original\", \"Moving Median\", \"Moving Mean\", \"Local Regression\")\nplot(new_study, style = \"grid2\")\n\n\n\n\nHere is the syntax for the upcoming scplot() function (see Chapter 15):\n\nscplot(new_study) %>% add_ridge()"
