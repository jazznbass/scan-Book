# Acknowledgement {-}

Obviously, as you are reading this, you got hold of an unfinished, uncorrected draft of this book.  
This might be OK if you received your copy directly from me, the author. But, in case you got it from someone else let me admit that I disapprove this.  
Do not get me wrong, I support open access to any print products including my own. But this is an unfinished product which I do not want to make publicly available as it is full of flaws and, moreover, procedures and functions all still in change and you might learn things that will not be applicable in the final version of *scan*. 
That is not how I want this book to be received.  
So do me a favor:
delete this copy and contact me at jwilbert@uni-potsdam.de and I will be happy to send you a more appropriate version of this book.  

Thank you!
